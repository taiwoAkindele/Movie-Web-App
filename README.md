## My process

-- Reactjs (create_react_app)
-- work with react useState Hook
-- Props
-- React Fragments
-- Forms & Labels in React
-- Events in React (onSubmit)
-- Fecthing Data with useEffect
-- React Router 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

.env file: This is my first solely built react app, so it is my first time learning about the .env file. I learnt this file can be used to protect sensitive information you need in your code but do not want exposed to the public.

queryParams / useLocation / useNavigate Hook: I was  able to reinforce my knowledge on queryParams / useLocation react hook. It is amazing what one can learn by practizing. 

### Continued development

I will like to learn more about pagination and how to use it. I tried using it in this project, I just could not seem to get it. So pagination is one thing I will like to learn. Also I will also continue with my React course and learn about more interesting things in the future.

### Useful resources

Used a lot of resources while on this project, I can't really remember them all.
